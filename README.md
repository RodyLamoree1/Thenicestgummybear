C+h freely unless I have "Dniuid" on!


‚õîÔ∏è[Certain rules:

1 Interact with caution, I'm not extremely sensitive but I can be more fragile from time to time

~MOST IMPORTANT-

I'm a Flippy IRL, I strictly believe that I am him

I don't have actual delusions, IRL is the only term that fits me the most and the only I feel comfortable using

I don't associate with his "evil" side

I can get uncomfortable being refered to as a cosplay, so if you spot me with my Flippy skin on then make sure to use proper wording

exmp: "You look nice!" instead of "Your Flippy looks nice!"
When it comes to doubles I usually just don't interact with them.

üêå THAT'S ALL!
