‚ú®Ô∏èHI! You can call me by Flippy or Jeff!

I mostly speak Polish and English
(I might do grammar mistakes)

My attitude is the same as yours so keep that in mind!

I mostly use he/him pronouns but I won't get mad if you use different ones


‚õîÔ∏è[Certain rules:

1 Don't approach me if I have "Dniuf" in my name and you're a stranger

2 Interact with caution, I'm not extremely sensitive but I can be more fragile from time to time

3 I'm extremely introverted and also suffer from social anxiety so keep that in mind

4 I'll be opening up to you once I get to know you better, it might take long or fast, depends!

5 Don't copy my skins without permission, inspo is allowed (excluding heavily)

6 I don't appreciate strangers making opinions about my skin, so please refrain from doing that,(You can still crown me tho!)

~MOST IMPORTANT-

I'm a Flippy IRL, I strictly believe that I am him

I don't have actual delusions, IRL is the only term that fits me the most

I don't associate with his "evil" side

I can get uncomfortable being refered to as a cosplay, so if you spot me with my Flippy skin on then make sure to use proper wording

exmp: "You look nice!" instead of "Your Flippy looks nice!"
When it comes to doubles I usually just don't interact with them.


üêå THAT'S ALL!
