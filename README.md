Hello, you can call me Flippy or Jeff! I speak Polish and English, however I can make some grammar mistakes.
____________________________________________

Firstly here are some basic things:

1. I mostly use male pronouns, I won't get upset if you use different ones, but I still would appreciate if you refrain from doing so.

2. Iwec. I'm not extremely fragile and I can handle a lot of things, but there are some that can make me uncomfortable, especially if we barely know each other.

3. Don't send me friend/party requests randomly, I will always decline since we didn't even have a convo.

4. I usually have dniuid or more specifically "fandom dniuid" when cosplaying a character from a fandom that I prefer people to not interact with me, unless I'm the first one to interact.

5. I have a bit of a dark humor, if you're uncomfortable with my jokes then lmk, I won't get mad lolz.

6. C+h freely unless I have dniuid on, that's pretty much it.

7. Don't copy my skins or take heavy inspo, even if you are my friend or something. I don't mind some minor inspo tho, so dw!

8. Don't make random comments about my skins, especially if you're a stranger and I didn't even ask for your opinion. You are allowed to crown me of course, just don't judge me or project your preferences onto me.

9. Always ooc, roleplayers dniuid. Ooc stands for "Out of character" it basically means that the person cosplaying a certain character doesn't really act like them. Which means they most likely don't want anyone to suddenly start roleplaying with them out of nowhere. For me personally, I might not always know the character I'm cosplaying quite well, and I also suck at roleplaying with people.

10. I will open to you once I know you better and start trusting you more. I also don't do any stuff like face or voice reveal so don't even bother asking.

11. I'm extremely introverted and have social anxiety.

12. I sometimes get non-verbal out of nowhere (literally unable to even touch the keyboard,it often makes me frustrated lol) That doesn't mean I'm ignoring you, my brain just need some time sometimes I guess.

13. My ocs always have "oc" in their names,otherwise it's a cosplay, etc.

Extra informations:

Sprout is probably my heaviest comf, I pretty much view him as my caretaker if that makes sense, hence why I am uncomfortable with any ships that includes him. Ever since I started getting into Dandy's World I right away felt extremely safe and content seeing him, whenever it would be someone playing as him or just in media. He puts my mind on ease pretty much.

Another heavy comf is Juice.
I sadly didn't become a fan before his passing, and I only been listening to him for a few years.
I find myself relating to him in some stuff, quite heavily to be honest, that's why I find him so comfortably.
His music really helps me a lot and it makes me feel less lonely.
Of course I wouldn't say I'm a hardcore fan, I don't know everything about him, however he's still very important to me, and I miss him so much, really wish he was still alive. 


999 forever.

Chapter 5 (The last one): Being a Flippy IRL.

Yeah Flippy from Happy Tree Friends.

I really strictly believe that I am him, whenever I see him I don't really see the character (if that makes sense) but instead me,if someone talks or mention him I pretty much feel like they're talking about me, rather than him as a character. When it comes to doubles I usually just avoid them and will most likely block them right away. I also sometimes feel uncomfortable with simply just cosplays, so I also usually avoid them.

Please do not refer to me as a "cosplay" basically what I'm talking about, is that if you see me having a Flippy skin on, and you happen to like it. Then make sure to use proper wording, exmp: "You look nice" instead of "Your flippy looks nice" or "Nice  Cos". It makes me extremely uncomfortable and weird since I'm not cosplaying him, I'm literally him irl, so please don't do that, even if you're a close friend.


I don't have actual delusions, "IRL" is the term that I feel the most comfortable using, and the most fitting for me.

I don't associate with his "evil side" (Fliqpy) this is all I gotta say basically.
