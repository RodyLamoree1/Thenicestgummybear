🥩 Primal prns are it/its. Only use pronouns that are mentioned. Only masc terms, no fem prns or terms. Fine with occasional he/him or they/them (don't overuse).

🥩 Most likely have anxiety disorders, not diagnosed as of now. I'm an introvert and socially awkward. My self esteem is also low. Please interact w extra caution.
